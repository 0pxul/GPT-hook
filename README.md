## I DONT SUPPORT USING AI FOR SCRIPTING WE MADE THIS FOR FUN
## IM MAKING IT OPEN SOURCE AND FREE
## tl;dr I'm a skid and have no clue what I'm doing


I was bored, so I made a simple ESP script for BlackHawk.
me and my friend and I wanted to see what we could make with AI lol
This is what we got after two days 
We used a bunch of AI models to see which would have the best results
out of the ones we tried 
Gemeni and Deepseek were horrible
ChatGPT did well but had issues
Then we found Claude. AI, and that is what we used 
We gave it a UI lib, and everything worked out
We couldn't figure out a way to render around players, so we just found the universal player model and rendered it around that
The issue is that it renders around NPCs, players, and ragdolls
